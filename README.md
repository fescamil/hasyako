Hasyako Constructed Language
==============================

Version 0.1


Overview of the Language
-----------------

The current plan is to develop it as much as possible, then make this repo public and talk about it on like Facebook or my blog or something. Maybe a video? I dunno what I'm doing.

Here's an example of what the language looks like. This is a translation of 'Twinkle twinkle'

Stiliva, stiliva, estilinda
twinkle, twinkle, little star

Livrabaram sematum mida
I wonder what you are

Binyeshme sholesh binyeshar
Skyward (above) the world very high

patilivea hiita binyesh
diamond-like within the sky

Stiliva, stiliva, estilinda
twinkle, twinkle, little star

Livrabaram sematum mida
I wonder what you are

TODO: Some notes about features
