Hasyako Constructed Language
==============================

Version 0.1


Overview of the Language
-----------------

Hasyako is a constructed language influenced by Estonian, Quenya, Pali and probably some other languages as well. I've taken some words and features directly from these languages, and made up a lot of things just as they take my fancy. The index below should have links to all the documents in this repo, which contains basically everything existant about this language. 

Here's an example of what the language looks like. This is a translation of 'Twinkle twinkle'

Stiliva, stiliva, estilinda
Livrabaram sematum mida
Binyeshme sholesh binyeshar
patilivea hiita binyesh
Stiliva, stiliva, estilinda
Livrabaram sematum mida

twinkle, twinkle, little star
I wonder what you are
Skyward (above) the world very high
diamond-like within the sky
twinkle, twinkle, little star
I wonder what you are

TODO: Some notes about features
