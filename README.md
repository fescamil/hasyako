Hasyako Constructed Language
==============================

Version 0.1


Overview of the Language
-----------------

Hasyako is a constructed language influenced by Estonian, Quenya, Pali and probably some other languages as well. I've taken some words and features directly from these languages, and made up a lot of things just as they take my fancy. The index below should have links to all the documents in this repo, which contains basically everything existant about this language.

TODO: Some notes about features
