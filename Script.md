### Script

For now, I'm just going to be using a modified Theban alphabet. I'm a little concerned that it might be oo ornate and whatever, but it looks pretty and I'll probably modify it as I use it, to become something a little more original.

Iâ€™m thinking of going with a system based on the theban alphabet where the shapes would indicate place of articulation, kind of like Tengwar, but with the shapes inspired by theban.

Vowels: stemless. Rounded closed shapes

Voiced consonants: written at bottom of stem

Voiceless consonants: written at top of stem

Palatalized consonants: tail crosses over stem

TODO: put some pictures in here.

TODO: some notes about the latin orthography
