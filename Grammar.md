## Direction
There must always be an external reference when talking abiut directions. There are cardinal direction words (nsew, etc) and theres an affix to indicate “towards “ a thing, sun-ward for example, but there is no “turn left at the next street” type of thing.

## Sentence structure
I was originally thinking SVO for sentance order but it will probably be more flexible than that.
